description: >
  Structured session ending ritual that captures completed work, pending tasks,
  and learnings before a session ends. Writes a handoff note to .claude/handoff.md
  so the next session (or a different developer) can pick up exactly where this
  session left off. Load this skill when the user signals they're wrapping up,
  says "let's stop here", "that's all for now", "end of session", "wrap up",
  "save progress", "handoff", or "I'm done for today".

# Wrap-Up Ritual

## Core Principles

1. **Sessions are ephemeral, knowledge is permanent** — When a session ends, context is lost. But learnings, decisions, and progress don't have to be. The wrap-up ritual bridges the gap between sessions by writing a handoff note.

2. **Three captures every time** — Every session ending captures exactly three things: what was DONE, what is PENDING, and what was LEARNED. No exceptions. Skipping any of these creates gaps for the next session.

3. **Handoff notes are written for a stranger** — Write the handoff as if the next person has zero context. Include file paths, decision rationale, and specific next steps. "Continue the refactor" is useless. "Refactor `src/Orders/CreateOrder.cs` to use the Result pattern — see the Catalog module for the established pattern" is actionable.

4. **Consistent location, always overwritten** — The handoff file lives at `.claude/handoff.md`. Each session overwrites the previous one — there's only ever one active handoff. Old handoffs are not valuable; current state is.

5. **Learnings flow to permanent memory** — The "learned" section of a wrap-up is a trigger for the `self-correction-loop` skill. Any correction or discovery worth remembering should be captured in `MEMORY.md` as a permanent rule, not just in the ephemeral handoff.

## Patterns

### Session Summary Template

The handoff file follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

> Generated: 2025-07-15 | Branch: feature/order-validation

## Completed
- [x] Added FluentValidation to CreateOrder command
  - File: `src/Orders/Features/CreateOrder.cs` (lines 15-35)
  - Validator checks: non-empty CustomerId, at least 1 item, positive quantities
- [x] Added integration test for validation
  - File: `tests/Orders.Tests/Features/CreateOrderTests.cs`
  - Tests: InvalidCustomerId_Returns400, EmptyItems_Returns400
- [x] Fixed N+1 query in GetOrderDetails
  - File: `src/Orders/Features/GetOrderDetails.cs` (line 28)
  - Added `.Include(o => o.Items)` to the query

## Pending
- [ ] Add validation to UpdateOrder command (same pattern as CreateOrder)
  - Start from: `src/Orders/Features/UpdateOrder.cs`
  - Reference: CreateOrder validator for the established pattern
- [ ] Run full test suite — last run had 2 unrelated failures in Catalog module
  - Failures: `CatalogTests.GetProduct_NotFound` and `CatalogTests.ListProducts_Pagination`
  - These appear pre-existing, not caused by today's changes

## Learned
- FluentValidation validators must be registered in the module's DI setup
  (added to `OrdersModule.cs` line 12) — easy to forget
- The N+1 in GetOrderDetails was not caught by existing tests because the test
  fixture seeds only 1 item per order. Consider adding multi-item test data.

## Context
- Working in the `feature/order-validation` branch
- All changes committed up to "Add CreateOrder validation + tests"
- No uncommitted changes
```

### Trigger Detection

Recognize when the user is ending a session:

```
EXPLICIT SIGNALS:
- "Let's wrap up"
- "That's all for today"
- "I'm done"
- "Save progress"
- "Let's stop here"
- "End of session"
- "Handoff"
- "Pick this up tomorrow"

IMPLICIT SIGNALS:
- User says "thanks" after a series of completed tasks
- User says "good enough for now"
- Long pause after completing a task followed by no new request

RESPONSE:
When you detect a wrap-up signal, offer to write the handoff:
"Let me write a handoff note to .claude/handoff.md so the next session
can pick up exactly where we left off."
```

### Learning Extraction at Session End

Before writing the handoff, review the session for learnings:

```
LEARNING EXTRACTION CHECKLIST:
1. Did the user correct anything? → Capture in MEMORY.md (via self-correction-loop)
2. Did we discover something non-obvious? → Add to "Learned" section
3. Did we make a decision with rationale? → Document the "why" in handoff
4. Did a tool/approach not work? → Note it so the next session doesn't retry
5. Did we find a pattern worth reusing? → Note for potential skill/memory addition

EXAMPLES OF GOOD LEARNINGS:
- "EF Core compiled queries don't work with Include() — use regular queries"
- "The payment gateway sandbox returns 500 on amounts > $10,000"
- "FluentValidation async validators need .MustAsync(), not .Must() with await"

EXAMPLES OF BAD LEARNINGS:
- "We worked on the Orders module" (too vague)
- "Things went well" (not actionable)
- "Used TimeProvider" (already a known rule, not a learning)
```

### Next-Session Quick Start

The handoff file enables a fast start in the next session:

```
NEXT SESSION WORKFLOW:
1. Claude reads .claude/handoff.md automatically
2. Claude reads MEMORY.md for permanent rules
3. Claude summarizes the current state:
   "Last session completed X, Y, Z. Pending: A, B. Shall I continue with A?"
4. User confirms or redirects
5. Claude picks up exactly where the previous session left off

This eliminates the "where were we?" problem entirely.
```

### Handoff for Different Developers

When the next session might be a different person:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

> Generated: 2025-07-15 | Branch: feature/order-validation | Author: @dev1

## Completed
- [x] Implemented CreateOrder with validation (see PR #142 for full diff)

## Pending
- [ ] **Needs review before merge**: CreateOrder validation rules
  - Reviewer should check: max order amount ($50,000 cap), currency handling
  - Open question: should we validate product existence at command level or handler level?
    - Current choice: handler level (after DB lookup) — but this means invalid product IDs
      return 500 instead of 400. Might want to reconsider.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Validation library | FluentValidation | Already used in Catalog module, consistent approach |
| Error response format | ProblemDetails | RFC 7807, aligns with error-handling skill |
| Validation timing | Before handler dispatch | Fail fast, don't waste DB roundtrips |
```

## Anti-patterns

### Abrupt Endings

```
// BAD — session ends with no capture
User: "Thanks, that's all!"
Claude: "You're welcome! Happy to help."
*Next session: "What were we working on? Let me read through the git log..."*

// GOOD — session ends with a handoff
User: "Thanks, that's all!"
Claude: "Before we wrap up, let me write a handoff note to .claude/handoff.md
         so the next session can pick up where we left off."
*Next session: reads handoff, immediately knows the state*
```

### Vague Handoffs

```
// BAD — handoff that doesn't help
## Completed
- Worked on Orders module

## Pending
- More work on Orders

// GOOD — specific, actionable handoff
## Completed
- [x] Added CreateOrder validation (src/Orders/Features/CreateOrder.cs:15-35)
- [x] Integration test for validation (tests/Orders.Tests/Features/CreateOrderTests.cs)

## Pending
- [ ] Add same validation pattern to UpdateOrder (src/Orders/Features/UpdateOrder.cs)
  - Reference CreateOrder validator for the pattern
```

### Accumulating Handoff Files

```
// BAD — creating timestamped handoff files
.claude/
├── handoff-2025-07-13.md
├── handoff-2025-07-14.md
├── handoff-2025-07-15.md
*3 files, unclear which is current, stale data accumulating*

// GOOD — single file, always overwritten
.claude/
├── handoff.md    ← always the current state
*Permanent learnings go to MEMORY.md, not handoff files*
```

### Skipping the Learning Extraction

```
// BAD — handoff without learnings
## Completed
- Fixed N+1 query
## Pending
- Nothing

*The discovery that seeded test data only has 1 item per order (hiding N+1s)
 is lost forever*

// GOOD — extract and preserve the insight
## Learned
- Test fixture seeds only 1 item per order, which hides N+1 queries.
  Consider adding multi-item test data to the default fixture.
→ Also added to MEMORY.md > Testing: "Seed test data with multiple
  child entities to catch N+1 queries"
```

## Decision Guide

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| User says "wrap up" / "that's all" / "done" | Write handoff to `.claude/handoff.md` |
| Session completed multiple tasks | List each with file paths and line numbers |
| Session had user corrections | Extract to MEMORY.md AND note in handoff Learned section |
| Next session is likely a different person | Include Decisions Made table with rationale |
| Session had no pending work | Still write a handoff — document what was completed and learned |
| Previous handoff exists | Overwrite it — only the current state matters |
| Work was on a feature branch | Include branch name and last commit message in handoff |
| Session ended with failing tests | Document which tests fail and suspected cause in Pending |
| User doesn't want a handoff | Respect it — but suggest capturing learnings in MEMORY.md at minimum |
| Session was purely exploratory (no code changes) | Write a lighter handoff with findings and recommendations |
